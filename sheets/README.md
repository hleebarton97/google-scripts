# My Google Sheets Scripts

## phoneNumber-format.js
Triggered when a cell is edited, this checks 
the value of the active cell if it's in 
column A and then removes any characters that 
are not numeric

## How To Use My Scripts:
If you want to use my scripts, open the appropriate 
document and click ```Tools > Script editor```

Once the script editor is open you should see an 
empty
```
function myFunction() {

}
```

You may need to create a project and name it.

Copy and paste the script into the function or 
replace the function. You can rename it if you
prefer.

You then need to setup a trigger for the function by 
clicking ```Edit > Current project's triggers```

You can then click ```+ Add Trigger``` in the bottom 
right.

Set the trigger you want and select the function name.

The script should start working!
