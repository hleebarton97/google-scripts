# My Google Doc Scripts

## code-font.js
Looks for the target string (`` in this case) and any text wrapped in these characters and then changes the font and removes those characters.
Inspired by Github's ``` code ``` format in the README.md files.
I have a timer event set at every minute for this script.

## How To Use My Scripts:
If you want to use my scripts, open the appropriate 
document and click ```Tools > Script editor```

Once the script editor is open you should see an 
empty
```
function myFunction() {

}
```

You may need to create a project and name it.

You then need to setup a trigger for the function by 
clicking ```Edit > Current project's triggers```

You can then click ```+ Add Trigger``` in the bottom 
right.

Set the trigger you want and select the function name.

The script should start working!
